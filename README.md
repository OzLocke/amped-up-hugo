 >Your site uses the [AMP framework](https://amp.dev). Make sure to adhere to it!

To use this project you'll need to first setup Hugo: https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/

Then simply clone it to a local folder and you can get to work!

There's just enough there already to enable you to run the site and have some basic functionality including a nav, and a mobile view...

![The site as it looks when run without changes](https://github.com/stephlocke/lazyCDN/blob/master/site.png?raw=true)

From here you can add your own theme, and build your site as usual. Just remember to update the config.toml file with your details and the associated logo files, and update or delete the netlify.toml as needed.
